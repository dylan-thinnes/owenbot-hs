Description : Everything commands :)

Amateur attempt at command abstraction and polyvariadic magic.

Inspired heavily but calamity-commands, which is provided by Ben Simms 2020
under the MIT license. 

Ideally, this module wouldn't need to be touched after its initial creation
(and hence quite the jump in complex GHC extensions compared to other modules),
however it is documented quite extensively anyway.

__As an OwenDev, you do not need to enable any GHC extensions, as the__
__extensions are used internally within this module only__.

=== __Notable extensions used (if you want to know)__

    * ScopedTypeVariables: For using the same type variables in @where@
    statements as function declarations.
    * FlexibleInstances: To allow complex type variables in instance declarations,
    like @CommandHandlerType m (a -> m ())@.
    [Read more]
    (https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/instances.html#extension-FlexibleInstances)
    * FunctionalDependencies: To write that @m@ can be determined from @h@ in
    @CommandHandlerType@. It makes logical sense to tell GHC this because @h@ 
    must be in the @m@ monad (otherwise, @h@ may be in another monad).
    [Read more]
    (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Advanced_type_classes)
    * MultiParamTypeClasses: For declaring CommandHandlerType that has 2 params.
    This comes with FunctionalDependencies automatically, and is not explicitly
    used.
    * UndecidableInstances: Risky, but I think I logically checked over it. Used
    in the @m (a -> b)@ instance declaration of 'CommandHandlerType', because
    @(a -> b)@ doesn't explicitly determine the required functional dependency
    (@h -> m@). The extension is risky because the type-checker can fail to
    terminate if the instance declarations recursively reference each other. In
    this module however, all instances strictly converges to the @m (m ())@
    instance so I say it is safe. [Read more]
    (https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5zjwym/when_is_undecidableinstances_okay_to_use/)
    * NamedFieldPuns: Shorten pattern matching ADT field names.

    -- * The fundamentals
    -- | These offer the core functionality for Commands. The most imporatnt
    -- functions are 'command' and 'runCommand'.
    -- 
    --     * 'command' creates a 'Command'
    --     * 'runCommand' converts the 'Command' to a normal receiver.
    --
    -- If your command demands a special syntax that is impossible with the
    -- existing 'command' function, use 'parsecCommand' (Parsec) or 'regexCommand'
    -- (Regex).

    -- As an OwenDev, if you want to make your own datatype parsable, all you
    -- have to do is to add an instance declaration for it (and a parser) inside
    -- @Command/Parser.hs@. Parsec offers very very very useful functions that
    -- you can simply compose together to create parsers.

    -- Discord REST API.

    -- ** MonadIO
    -- | Exported solely for convenience purposes, since many modules that use
    -- Commands require the MonadIO constraint, but it can get confusing where
    -- to import it from (UnliftIO or Control.Monad.IO.Class). The one exported
    -- from this module is from "Control.Monad.IO.Class" which is in @base@.

    -- * Common Errors #commonerrors#
    -- | Here are some common errors that can occur when defining commands.
    -- They may appear cryptic, but they are most of the time dealable.
    --
    -- @
    -- Could not deduce (ParsableArgument p0) arising from the use of \'command'.
    -- The type variable 'p0' is ambiguous.
    -- @
    --     * The type for one of the arguments to your handler function cannot
    --     be inferred. Make sure you use the argument, otherwise, just remove it.
    --
    -- @
    -- Could not deduce (ParsableArgument SomeType) arising from the use of
    -- \'command'.
    -- @
    --
    --     * The type could be inferred as SomeType, but it's not an instance
    --     of ParsableArgument. Contribute your own parser in @Command/Parser.hs@.
    --
    -- @
    -- Could not deduce (MonadIO m) arising from the use of \'liftIO'.
    -- @
    --
    --     * Your handler requires IO actions, but you haven't given the
    --     appropriate constraint. Add @(MonadIO m)@.
    --     * Rationale: This happens because some handlers are pure and don't need IO -
    --     it's better to explicitly signify which actions you're going to use
    --     in the constraints than to add a catch-all constraint into the
    --     definition of @MonadDiscord@.
    -- 
    -- If an error is super duper cryptic, it may be a bug in the Commands 
    -- module itself, in which case we may need a rewrite.
